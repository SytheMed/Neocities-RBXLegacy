The entire website source of Win's RBXLegacy Server straight from Neocities. This is a very stripped down version of the original RBXLegacy website which has 
been made into a completely static website made only of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is no PHP or SQL in it like the original version and all the other themes
were removed. The original theme was modified a little bit too with the color being changed on the banner from red to blue.

Original Website: http://rbxl.000webhostapp.com/
